        <h4>Concept</h4>
        <p>Our client’s request was a crossfit circuit training gym for obnoxious cool athletes of females and males genders in RAK, UAE. Healthy men and women between the age of 18-34 with a yearly income of 100,000 and can’t live without sports. The gym proposed name was Wolf Gym. Throughout research we found that wolfs and crossfit/circuit training share Community in common. Community comes from Common as in common goals and unity to unite to achieve.</p>
        <p>Crossfit is usually called the box it is a space where athletes share their achievements and work together to achieve more which is similar to how wolves always stay in packs.</p>
        <h4>Mission</h4>
        <p>Is to provide and challenge members to reach their full potential in a safe and community based environment that focuses on health, fitness and well-being.</p>
        <h4>Vision</h4>
        <p>Is to positively transform the lives of our members with our exceptional training and friendly community.</p>
        <h4>Values</h4>
        <p>Community/Dedication/Perseverance/Safety Trust</p>
        <h4>Logo concept</h4>
        <p>The concept of the gym was to highlight the sense of community and trust. We achieved trust through the concept of the trust circle. In order to feel that you belong to a community trust should exists. We started translating simple forms to create the circle of trust, and kept on experimenting with those forms until we created a logo that signifies trust, community, And movement. The color choice was to imply the movement and the obnoxiously cool gym.</p>
