      <h4 class="big-magic">Concept -</h4>
      <p>A book cover redesign of Elizabeth Gilbert's book "BIG MAGIC", and adding an augmented reality experience using a motion piece demonstration. Colours from the old book cover were used to form brightful colour blocks and with the help of
        paint brush strokes that are layered to give that paint splash effect that forms the liveliness and happiness the old cover design gave readers.</p>
      <p>The main aspect of this school assignment was to create an augmented reality piece that showcases what readers see when they place their phone camera above the book cover.</p>
