         <p class="kilo">After studying Graphic design for almost 5 years and adapting to two completely different design systems from the East and West, my appreciation and love for design grew more and my understanding of its principals became better. My goal in life is for sure to keep trying something new and exciting everyday and would like to work with a team of designers that will add to my abilities and help me with utilizing my graphic and creative skills to produce top-notch quality work in the near future.</p>
